# Take me home Challenge
Collection of take me home challenges

Each file in this repository describes a take me home challenge, as given by the issue-ing company. Some are more or less reasonable.

Please make sure you do not distribute this repository or the datasets as they do come from real companies.

## Challenges


|  Challenge | Data tables  | Complexity  |
|---|---|---|
| [Data Scientist TriAD](data_scientist_triad.md)  | takemehome.triad  |  Easy-to-Medium, depending if only EDA, the rest is not achievable in 4-6 hours |
| [Data Analyst Artsy](data_analyst_artsy.md)   |   takemehome.artsy_test_user &  takemehome.artsy_pageviews   |  Easy to Medium (easiest from all)  |
| [Senior Data Scientist / Engineer K](senior_data_scientist_engineer_k.md)  | takemehome.k_notifications  |  Medium to Difficult, depending on how clean and modular you want to make the code  |
[Product Analyst Amboss](product_analyst_amboss.md)   |   takemehome.amboss_user_profile &  takemehome.amboss_trial_conversions   |  Easy to Medium (can also be done in SQL)  |
[Data Scientist Prognostica](data_science_prognostica_de.md)   |   takemehome.prognostica_afo &  prognostica_daten_kunden   |  Medium (requires Time Series Knowledge and is in German)  |


## Deliverables

Each challenge will have its own deliverables, some a bit too much than the allocated time. What you need to make sure you have:

Notebook with EDA/Modelling:
 - explanation of task ( you can repeat the text from the challenge in the notebook)
 - code and viz
 - everything documented
 - conclusions
 - every data question/task mentioned in the challenge should be tackled!


**Note:**  *If it is not written down, it does not exist!* When you submit TMH challenges the companies evaluated them most of the time in your absence, so it is more important that you explain everything you do and why than do more things!

## Presentation

Each person gets 3 minutes to scroll through their work, any graph that is not interpreted in text cannot be talked about. Why? When you submit a challenge like this, this will be the time the person will allocate to browse over it and you will not be in the room to defend it.

## Getting the data

Connect to the ds-sql-playground database with the bootcamp username and password in order to get the data.
